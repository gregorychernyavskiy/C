# C and C++ Advanced Programming Techniques

This repository contains the coursework and projects from the **CS 3270: Advanced Programming Techniques** course at Iowa State University (Spring 2025).

## Course Overview
The course explores advanced programming concepts using C and C++. Topics include:
- Memory management
- Parameter passing
- Inheritance
- Compiling and debugging
- Designing and maintaining large programs

## Course Objectives
1. Understand differences between managed and unmanaged languages (e.g., Java vs. C/C++).
2. Develop and debug large programs using modern build systems like `make`.
3. Implement advanced features of C++ like templates and the standard template library.

## Final Project: Dungeon Game
By the end of the course, we will build a Roguelike ASCII dungeon game with features such as:
- Randomly generated dungeon maps
- Turn-based gameplay with keyboard input
- Saving and restoring game progress
- Items and monsters defined in external files for compatibility with peers' games

## Repository Contents
This repository includes:
- Lecture notes and exercises in C and C++
- Smaller projects and assignments leading to the final game
